Games developed in Unity

# Intro
Starting learning paths on Unity website to pursue my long-time dream of becoming a game developer.
It's starting as an hobby, but who knows.

# Karting Microgame
Simple karting game.
All the assets were provided by Unity through their tutorial in the initial learning path.

What I have done:
- Edited track adding jumps, obstacles and checkpoints.
- Added fireworks effects on last checkpoint.
